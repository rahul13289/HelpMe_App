App description:

1. Help me button: Pressing the SOS button on the app's homepage will automatically send your current location and a video to the Kavalan team, who will contact you within a minute.
2. Pre-registered emergency contacts: Your location will also be sent to your pre-registered emergency contacts as SMS alerts.
3. Offline mode: The app works in offline mode as well, sending alerts via SMS.
4. Video recording: The app automatically records a video through your back camera after pressing the SOS button.
5. Secure data: All user data is stored in a secure server.
6. Emergency situations covered: The app can be used to report any emergency situation, including eve teasing, kidnapping, molestation, domestic violence, sexual violence, and natural disasters.
7. Arduino board: The kit connected with buzzer and led light indicates when there is emergency and after the recovery the ligt turns off.

Hardware requirements:

1. Node MCU Board
2. ESP01 ESP8266 serial WiFi transceiverÂ module

Hardware connectivity:

GPIO 0 and GPIO 2: These pins are used for flashing the ESP8266 with new firmware.
GPIO 15: This pin is used to reset the ESP8266.
GPIO 16: This pin is used to put the ESP8266 into deep sleep mode.
GPIO 4, GPIO 5, GPIO 12, GPIO 13, GPIO 14, GPIO 2, GPIO 15, GPIO 3, GPIO 1, GPIO 10, and GPIO 9: These pins are general-purpose input/output (GPIO) pins that can be used for various purposes, such as connecting sensors, actuators, and displays.
Important note: The ESP8266 NodeMCU kit pinout diagram may vary depending on the manufacturer of the board. It is always best to consult the board's documentation to confirm the pinout diagram.
